## SQL Introduction

The goal of this project was to use sql to analyze data for employees of a fictional company. First, a ERD was made to understand the relationships between all the different csv files. I started by looking at all the csv files and figuring out the relationships between them. Then the csv files needed to be added to Postgres. First, a guide was made using sql so all the csv files could be added correctly. I coded all the tables with all the columns into Postgres. Then all the csv files with the data could be added. 

For the data analysis section, I used the tables I had made to analyze the data in different ways. I used inner joins, group bys, and filtering to find different information in the data.
